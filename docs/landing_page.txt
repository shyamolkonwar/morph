# **Landing Page Architecture & Strategy**

## **1. Design Philosophy**

* **Visual Identity:** Clean, "Editor-like" aesthetic. Use a dark mode UI with bright accent colors (like Figma or VS Code) to signal that this is a *tool* for professionals, not a toy.
* **Core Message:** "Stop resizing manually. One prompt fits all."
* **Tech Leverage:** Use **Next.js** for SEO and blazing fast load speeds (LCP/CLS optimization).

## **2. Page Anatomy (Section by Section)**

### **A. The Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

* **Headline:** High-impact value prop.
* *Example:* "Generate LinkedIn Carousels & Banners in Seconds. Perfectly Sized."


* **Sub-headline:** Explain the magic mechanism.
* *Example:* "Type one prompt. Our AI writes the copy, designs the background, and auto-formats it for LinkedIn, YouTube, and X."


* **Primary Call to Action (CTA):** "Generate Your First Banner" (Directs to Auth/App).
* **Visual Hero Asset:** A dynamic looping video or animation showing:
1. A prompt being typed.
2. The screen splitting into three viewports (Carousel, Wide Banner, Thumbnail).
3. All three populating simultaneously.



### **B. The "Interactive" Playground (The Hook)**

* *Instead of just screenshots, build a "fake" generator.*
* **Component:** A text input field that is pre-filled with a prompt like "Announcement for a Series A funding round."
* **Interaction:** When the user hovers or clicks "Simulate," show a transformation effect that cycles through pre-rendered results (using Next.js Image optimization) to demonstrate speed and quality without actually spending API credits.

### **C. The "Problem vs. Solution" Comparison**

* **Left Side (The Old Way):** Screenshot of a messy Photoshop interface or distorted text from Midjourney. Label: "Hours of resizing & broken text."
* **Right Side (Your Way):** Your clean UI with perfect typography and layout. Label: "Ready to post in 30 seconds."
* **Key Differentiator:** Highlight that your text is *rendered code*, not *hallucinated pixels* (crisp, readable, editable).

### **D. Feature Grid (Bento Box Style)**

* **Feature 1:** **Multi-Format Export.** (Icons for LinkedIn, YT, Twitter).
* **Feature 2:** **Nano Banana Pro Integration.** "Powered by the world's most advanced image models for photorealistic backgrounds."
* **Feature 3:** **Brand Kits.** "Upload your logo and hex codes once. Every generation stays on brand."
* **Feature 4:** **Smart Layouts.** "Our engine understands context—shifting layouts for thumbnails vs. carousels."

### **E. Technical Trust Section**

* Since your target audience includes professionals, show off the stack lightly.
* "Built on GPT-4o for intelligent copy."
* "Vector-sharp text rendering."

### **F. Pricing & FAQ**

* **Free Tier:** 3 generations/month (Hook them in).
* **Pro Tier:** Unlimited generations, Custom Fonts, No Watermark.

## **3. Technical Implementation (Next.js)**

### **Framework & SEO**

* **Next.js App Router:** Use for the landing page structure.
* **Metadata API:** Dynamically generate `og:image` tags for the landing page *using your own tool's engine* (eat your own dog food).
* **Fonts:** `next/font` (Inter or Geist Sans) to ensure zero layout shift.

### **Animations & Interactivity**

* **Framer Motion:** Use this library for "scroll reveal" animations. As the user scrolls down, the "banner examples" should slide into place or resize dynamically to mimic the product's behavior.

### **Performance Optimization**

* **Lazy Loading:** Use `next/image` for all showcase screenshots.
* **Edge Caching:** Cache the static parts of the landing page on the Vercel Edge Network so it loads instantly globally.

## **4. User Conversion Flow (The Funnel)**

1. **Visitor Lands:** Sees the "One Prompt, All Sizes" promise.
2. **The Trigger:** Visitor clicks "Try for Free."
3. **Auth (Supabase):**
* Do not ask for a password.
* Use **Supabase Magic Link** or **Google OAuth** ("Continue with Google"). This reduces friction significantly.


4. **Onboarding:**
* Immediately redirect to the `/create` page.
* **Crucial:** Give them *5 free credits* immediately upon sign-up so they can experience the "Aha!" moment without paying first.

## **5. Copywriting Checklist**

* **Avoid:** "AI-powered image generator" (Too generic).
* **Use:** "AI-powered **Layout** Engine" (Specific, high-value).
* **Focus on Utility:** "Get 10x more reach on LinkedIn with formatted carousels" (Benefit-driven) vs "We use GPT-4" (Feature-driven).
