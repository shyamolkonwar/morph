# **Phase 4: The "Morph Engine" Abstraction Layer**

## **1. The Model Naming Matrix**

We will refer to our AI stack collectively as **"The Morph Intelligence Engine."**
Internally, we map these proprietary names to the actual providers.

| **Provider Model** | **Internal Code Reference** | **Public/Marketing Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GPT-4o** | `MODEL_TEXT_CORE` | **Morph-1.1 (Architect)** | The reasoning engine that parses prompts and structures layouts. |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | `MODEL_IMAGE_CORE` | **Morph-Vision v2** | The rendering engine that generates high-fidelity backgrounds and assets. |
| **OpenAI Moderation** | `MODEL_SAFETY_GUARD` | **Morph-Shield** | The security layer that filters abuse and unsafe content. |

## **2. Technical Implementation (The "Black Box")**

Do not hardcode strings like `"gpt-4o"` inside your API routes. Instead, create a central configuration file. This is the **only** place where the actual provider names should exist.

### **A. Configuration: `ai-registry.ts**`

* **Purpose:** A single source of truth for model mapping.
* **Structure:**
* Define constants for your proprietary names.
* Map them to the provider strings.


* **Benefit:** If GPT-5 comes out, you update this one file. The rest of the app still calls "Morph-1.1" (or you upgrade the internal version to "Morph-1.2"), and nothing breaks.

### **B. API Response Headers**

When your API responds to the frontend, never send back metadata like `server: openai`.

* **Header to Add:** `X-Powered-By: Morph-Engine-v1`
* **Metadata Stripping:** Ensure your backend acts as a proxy. The frontend should only see the JSON layout, not the raw OpenAI completion object.

## **3. Public Documentation & Marketing Guidelines**

All copy on the Landing Page, Pricing Page, and User Dashboard must strictly adhere to this nomenclature.

### **A. How to describe the Technology**

* **❌ Don't say:** "We use GPT-4o to write your text and Gemini to make images."
* **✅ Do say:** "Powered by **Morph-1.1**, our proprietary layout engine trained on high-converting social media posts."

### **B. How to describe the Image Generation**

* **❌ Don't say:** "AI generated images." (Too generic/cheap).
* **✅ Do say:** "Context-Aware Assets generated by **Morph-Vision**."

### **C. The "Secret Sauce" Narrative**

You are selling the **orchestration**, not the raw intelligence.

* *Marketing Copy:* "Morph-1.1 doesn't just write text. It understands design hierarchy, creating layouts that fit your content perfectly—something standard LLMs can't do."

---

## **4. Error Handling & Fallbacks**

Your system messages should also reflect this branding to maintain immersion, even when things break.

* **Standard Error:** "OpenAI API Rate Limit Exceeded."
* **Morph Rebranded Error:** "Morph Engine is currently at capacity. Our GPUs are cooling down. Please try again in 30 seconds."
* **Standard Error:** "Safety settings triggered."
* **Morph Rebranded Error:** "Morph-Shield detected content that violates our safe-use policy."

---

## **5. Future Proofing (Versioning)**

As you improve the prompts or switch models, update the version number to signal improvement to users.

* **Launch Day:** **Morph-1.0** (Beta)
* **Update 1 (Better Prompts):** **Morph-1.1** ("Now with smarter hashtag suggestions!")
* **Update 2 (Switch to GPT-5):** **Morph-2.0** ("Our biggest update yet.")
