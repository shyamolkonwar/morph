Phase 11: The "Generative Designer" Architecture
1. The Fundamental Shift
Currently, your AI picks a template (id: "founder_split") and fills the text blanks. To become a "Graphic Designer," the AI must invent the layout on the fly.
Old Way: AI selects Template A, B, or C.
New Way (Generative UI): AI composes a custom layout using "Lego Blocks" (React Components).
2. The "Atomic Design" System
Instead of building 3 massive templates, you will build 20-30 micro-components (Atoms). The AI's job is to arrange them on a canvas.

The Lego Box (Component Registry)
You give the AI a list of available tools in the System Prompt:
<Typography /> (Props: size, weight, font, gradient)
<GlassCard /> (Props: opacity, blur, border)
<Badge /> (Props: color, icon, text)
<ShapeBlob /> (Props: color, position, rotation)
<GridPattern /> (Props: density, opacity)
<StockPhoto /> (Props: query, position, blendMode)
3. The "Director" System Prompt
We need a new "Morph-Designer" model (still Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro) that understands Layout Composition.

The Output Schema (JSON Tree): The AI no longer outputs flat text. It outputs a Component Tree.

JSON
{
  "canvas": { "bg_color": "#0f172a", "width": 1584, "height": 396 },
  "layers": [
    {
      "component": "GridPattern",
      "props": { "opacity": 0.1, "color": "#ffffff" }
    },
    {
      "component": "StockPhoto",
      "props": {
        "query": "minimalist office desk",
        "position": "right-half",
        "blend_mode": "overlay"
      }
    },
    {
      "component": "GlassCard",
      "style": { "x": 100, "y": 80, "width": 600 },
      "children": [
        {
          "component": "Typography",
          "props": { "text": "Scale Your SaaS", "variant": "h1_gradient" }
        },
        {
          "component": "Typography",
          "props": { "text": "We build systems that scale.", "variant": "body_dim" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
4. Dynamic Vector Generation (The "Art" Layer)
To match the "creativity" of image generators, your code needs to generate artistic assets dynamically.

A. Algorithmic Shapes
Do not use static PNGs for shapes. Use Generative SVGs.
Blobs: Use a library like blobs-2 to generate unique random organic shapes every time.
Gradients: The AI selects 3 colors, and your CSS constructs a complex conic-gradient or mesh-gradient.
B. The "Noise" Texture
To make the banner look less "digital" and more "high-end print," always apply a 5% opacity CSS noise overlay on top of everything.

5. The "Render Engine" Update
Your Frontend (Next.js) becomes a Rendering Engine that loops through the JSON layers array.

JavaScript
// Simplified Concept
const ComponentMap = {
  Typography: TypographyComponent,
  GlassCard: GlassCardComponent,
  StockPhoto: StockPhotoComponent,
  // ...
};

function LayerRenderer({ layers }) {
  return layers.map((layer, index) => {
    const Component = ComponentMap[layer.component];
    return (
      <div style={layer.style} key={index}>
        <Component {...layer.props}>
           {layer.children && <LayerRenderer layers={layer.children} />}
        </Component>
      </div>
    );
  });
}
6. How to Train the "Designer" (Few-Shot Prompting)
To get "Professional" results, you must teach the AI good taste. In your System Prompt, provide 3 examples of "High-Quality Layouts" (JSON examples).
Rule 1: "Never put white text on a light background."
Rule 2: "Use negative space. Do not clutter."
Rule 3: "If the user is a 'Developer', use monospaced fonts and dark themes.".
